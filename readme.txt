== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't have freebies to offer. Can I use this plugin simply as a default Subscription Form ? =

Yes, if you don't provide any downloadable file in the plugin settings, then it will just act as the normal subscription form.

= How is downloadable file received to the subscriber? =

The subscriber will receive the link of the downloadable file in the email through which subscriber will be able to download.

= How can I prevent the subscribers from direct link sharing of downloadable item?
Our plugin do have the feature to encrypt the download link so that it will only valid for the specific subscriber.

= What happens when I turn on Encrypt Download Link? = 
When this option is turned on in the general settings, our plugin will send the encrypted download link instead of the direct file link for download and our plugin will use the browser cookies to verify if the link has been clicked from the same browser or not from which the subscription has been done. If the link has been clicked from different browser then it will just open the home page which will prevent the direct link sharing. And also it will help to track the download status for the specific subscriber. 

= When I click on the download link, it opens the home page instead of downloading the file? =
